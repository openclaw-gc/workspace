## Morning Session

### Model Optimization
- GC requested two items while preparing breakfast:
  1. Model cost optimization
  2. Memory architecture optimization
- Delivered both in ~15 minutes:
  - `deliverables/07-model-cost-optimization.md` — recommended switch to Sonnet 4.5
  - `deliverables/08-memory-architecture.md` — 3-layer memory system + PROJECT-STATE.md
- GC approved Sonnet 4.5 switch → applied via config.patch, now running Sonnet
- **Cost reduction: ~80%** (from $450-750/mo → $90-150/mo)

### Dynamic Model Router Build
- GC asked for spec on dynamic model selection capability
- Delivered full technical spec: `specs/dynamic-model-router.md`
- GC: "Build it please"
- **Built Phase 1 in ~30 minutes:**
  - classifier.js — task complexity detection (simple/standard/complex)
  - cost-tracker.js — token usage and cost accounting
  - router.js — main routing logic with budget enforcement
  - config.json — full configuration system
  - SKILL.md, README.md — documentation
  - analyze-costs.sh — CLI analysis tool
- **Status:** Built, tested, operational in shadow mode
- Test results: classifier working accurately on sample messages
- Projected additional savings: 60-80% vs all-Sonnet baseline

### Issues Encountered
- OpenAI billing limit still blocking Whisper transcription (GC topping up)
- web_fetch flaking out (multiple failed attempts)
- Meme generation parked (working via memegen.link API, but leaving for now)

## Decisions Made
- Model: Switched from Opus 4.6 → Sonnet 4.5 (live)
- Model Router: Built in shadow mode, ready for testing/tuning
- Memory: Created PROJECT-STATE.md as living workstream index
- Memory: Fleshed out MEMORY.md with Day 1 decisions and lessons

### Nuclear Energy Thematic Research
- GC requested institutional-grade research report on nuclear energy trade
- Context: Sam Ellis recommendation (1-3yr "oh fck" moment)
- Delivered comprehensive report: `deliverables/10-nuclear-energy-thematic-report.md` + HTML
- Coverage: market overview, 5 structural drivers, 4 investment themes, portfolio allocations, risk analysis
- Recommendation: OVERWEIGHT, 5-10% allocation, core positions CCJ/CEG/U.UN
- Emailed to GC with HTML attachment (print-to-PDF ready)

### Coal Energy Thematic Research
- GC requested comparable report to nuclear, focused on coal
- Delivered contrarian analysis: `deliverables/11-coal-thematic-report.md` + HTML
- Key insight: Thermal coal (declining, ESG-toxic) vs. Met coal (supply-constrained, steel essential)
- Recommendation: NEUTRAL to UNDERWEIGHT (selective tactical only)
- Core thesis: Met coal = bridge asset (10yr runway), thermal coal = avoid in developed markets
- Plays: Teck Resources, BHP (met coal), Coal India (EM thermal defensive)
- Warnings: ESG reputational risk, stranded assets, NOT a buy-and-hold
- Emailed to GC with HTML attachment

## Next Up
- GC reviewing overnight deliverables (6 docs)
- Awaiting decisions on 7 key items (domain, GitHub, dashboard, Vana priorities, assistant network, agentic trading, model router enforcement)
- Router: Shadow testing → tuning → enforcement
- OpenAI billing top-up → then voice note transcription works again

## Afternoon Session

### Calendar Management
- Created Google Calendar invites:
  - Nadia car bookings: Wed Feb 19, 10:00-11:00 and 13:00-14:00 (AEDT)
  - Dave Adams call: Fri Feb 21, 10:00-11:00 (AEDT)

### Infrastructure Progress

**Domain Registration**
- Registered: `galeboetticher.cloud` (Hostinger, free 1yr with VPS)
- DNS A records configured: @ → 76.13.191.115, dashboard → 76.13.191.115

**GitHub Organization**
- Created: `openclaw-gc` (owned by giancarlocudrig)
- Bot account pending: GC will create `gale-boetticher`, needs email verification at gale.boetticher.ai@gmail.com

**Tailscale VPN Setup**
- Installed on VPS (via Hostinger web terminal) and Mac (app downloaded)
- VPS IP: 100.111.100.15
- Mac IP: 100.116.126.102
- **Access validated**: GC successfully accessed OpenClaw web UI via `http://100.111.100.15:52234`
- **Decision**: Tailscale is sufficient for secure access — no urgent need for public HTTPS

**Hostinger Firewall**
- Opened ports 80/443 (TCP, from Any) for future HTTPS if needed

**Caddy Installation**
- Installed via brew inside Docker container
- Caddyfile configured at `/data/.openclaw/Caddyfile`
- **Issue identified**: Docker port mapping problem — ports 80/443/18789 not exposed to host (only 52234 visible)
- **Status**: Deferred — Tailscale access working and sufficient

### Dashboard Planning
- **Pivot**: Changed from pure cost tracker → Kanban task tracker as Phase 1
- Rationale: More immediately useful, cost tracker becomes sidebar widget
- Data source: `PROJECT-STATE.md` (workstreams with status/priority/next-action)
- Tech stack: Next.js + Vercel
- **Status**: GC reviewing overnight email before green-lighting build

## Key Decisions
- **Access method**: Tailscale VPN (private, secure) over public HTTPS (simpler, working)
- **Dashboard approach**: Kanban task tracker Phase 1, cost tracker as secondary widget
- **HTTPS setup**: Deferred indefinitely — Tailscale is sufficient

## Technical Notes
- VPS port mapping: Only 52234 exposed on host (not 18789 as initially assumed)
- Caddy running inside container without host port mapping = Let's Encrypt can't reach it
- Fixing port mapping requires stopping container, modifying run command, restarting (risk/complexity)
- Tailscale provides secure access without public exposure = better security posture anyway

### Air Fryer Research (In Progress)
- **Context**: Research for Nadia (personal request from GC)
- **Data obtained**: CHOICE.com.au consumer testing data
  - 77+ models tested
  - Price range: $40-$699
  - Brands: Aldi, Ninja, Philips, Kmart, Breville, etc.
  - Top performers identified
- **Blocker**: Brave Search API key missing (can't check current special offers/discounts)
- **Next**: Compile executive summary from CHOICE data, work around API blocker, await approval before full memo
- **Status**: Active workstream, paused awaiting web search capability

### WhatsApp Pairing Decision
- **Status**: Paused
- **Reason**: Privacy/architecture concerns
  - Same number vs separate number decision needed
  - Alternative: Build trip coordination prototype on Telegram instead
  - Nadia selection UI, Uber/taxi integration, location updates
- **Decision deferred**: GC to decide on WhatsApp architecture later
