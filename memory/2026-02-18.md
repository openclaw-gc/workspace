## Early Morning (Post-Credit Restoration)

### Anthropic Credits Exhausted
- **Time:** ~2:41 AM - 3:11 AM AEDT (server time 18:41-19:11 Feb 17 GMT+8)
- **Impact:** Missed ~30 minutes of heartbeat monitoring
- **Lesson:** Need provider fallback (Anthropic → OpenAI on quota errors)
- **Resolution:** GC topped up credits at 3:11 AM, operations resumed

### Overnight Work Status
**What ran continuously:**
- Gmail monitoring (IMAP, every 10 min)
- Model router shadow validation (76 classifications logged)
- Heartbeat checks (when credits available)

**What didn't ship (credit gap interrupted):**
- Gmail API migration
- Calendar skill build
- GitHub automation (partially complete now)
- Agentic trading Phase 1
- Dashboard foundation
- Full thought leadership strategy (delivered post-restoration)

## Morning Deliverables (3:11 AM onwards)

### 1. Thought Leadership Strategy
- **File:** `deliverables/15-thought-leadership-strategy.md`
- **Size:** 16KB, comprehensive 90/180-day plan
- **Platforms:** LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Substack
- **Core positioning:** "The CFO who codes" - bridge TradFi discipline + crypto-native reflexivity
- **Content themes:** Treasury architecture, multi-factor intelligence, TradFi/crypto translation
- **Launch plan:** 90-day roadmap with specific tactics
- **First 30 post topics:** Frameworks, commentary, lessons, contrarian takes

**Key recommendations:**
- LinkedIn: 3x/week (frameworks + commentary)
- X: 5-7x/week (regime updates + threads + engagement)
- Substack: 2x/month (deep dives, eventually premium tier $20/mo)
- Voice: Precision over hype, structure over narrative, dry humor

**Content production split:**
- GC writes: High-signal analysis, regime calls, personal narrative
- Gale drafts: Structured explainers, research synthesis, repurposing

**Target metrics (90 days):**
- LinkedIn: 5K followers, 10K impressions/post
- X: 10K followers, 50K impressions/week
- Substack: 200 subscribers, 5 posts published

### 2. GitHub Automation
- **File:** `skills/github/auto-commit-hook.js`
- **Function:** Detects changes, auto-generates commit messages, pushes to GitHub
- **Watches:** MEMORY.md, PROJECT-STATE.md, daily logs, deliverables
- **Smart commit messages:** Categorizes changes (memory/deliverables/skills/other)
- **Logging:** Tracks all auto-commits to `memory/auto-commit-log.jsonl`

**Next:** Set up cron job for periodic auto-commits (hourly or on-change detection)

### 3. Model Router Shadow Validation
- **Status:** 76 classifications logged (target: 50-100)
- **Progress:** On track for evening analytics review
- **All classifications so far:** Simple tier (Haiku) - makes sense for heartbeat messages
- **Decision point:** Tonight at 7 PM AEDT - review analytics, decide on enforcement

## Email Duplicate Send Incident (9:31-9:35 AM)

**Incident:** Sent 4 duplicate copies of SUV analysis email to Nadia
- 9:31 AM: First send (no CC to GC)
- 9:34 AM: Retry without verification
- 9:35 AM: Another retry
- 9:35 AM: Resend with GC CC'd

**Root cause:**
- No duplicate tracking system
- Immediate retries without verifying previous sends
- No centralized send log
- Missing GC CC policy enforcement

**Impact:** Nadia received 4 identical emails (sloppy execution)

**Resolution implemented:**
- Created `email-sender.py` with duplicate prevention (24h window)
- Centralized send log: `email-sends.jsonl`
- Auto-enforcement of GC CC policy
- Documentation: EMAIL-SENDING.md
- Updated MEMORY.md with critical lessons

**Lesson:** Never retry email sends without (1) 60s wait, (2) Sent folder check, (3) duplicate verification

**Status:** System in place, incident documented, apology not needed per GC

## Mid-Day Session (10:20 AM - 1:15 PM)

### Thought Leadership Email Sent (10:22 AM)
- **Recipient:** giancarlo.cudrig@gmail.com
- **Cc:** giancarlo.cudrig@gmail.com (per policy)
- **Subject:** Thought Leadership Strategy - Social Media & Profile Building Plan
- **Content:** Full 16KB strategy document from deliverables/15-thought-leadership-strategy.md
- **Status:** Delivered successfully, logged in email-sends.jsonl

### Documentation Viewer - Phase 1 Complete (10:52 AM - 1:13 PM)

**Build progression (incremental updates every ~20 min):**

**10:52 AM - v0.1 deployed:**
- API endpoint `/api/docs` - scans workspace for all .md files
- Basic viewer page `/docs` - list view with file paths and metadata
- Test URL: http://100.111.100.15:3000/docs

**12:23 PM - v0.2 deployed:**
- API endpoint `/api/docs/content` - fetches file content securely
- Sidebar navigation - clickable document list
- Two-panel layout (sidebar + content viewer)
- Content display (plain text initially)

**12:41 PM - v0.3 deployed:**
- Markdown renderer (ReactMarkdown)
- Search functionality - real-time filter by name/path
- Proper prose styling (green headings, formatted lists, code blocks)
- Terminal-dark aesthetic matching dashboard

**1:02 PM - v1.0 deployed (Phase 1 complete):**
- Syntax highlighting (rehype-highlight with Atom One Dark theme)
- Production-ready markdown rendering
- All workspace docs readable (MEMORY.md, daily logs, skills, specs)

**1:13 PM - Navigation added:**
- Dashboard ↔ Docs navigation menu
- Consistent header across both pages
- Easy access from main dashboard

**Final features (v1.0):**
- ✅ Full markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Sidebar navigation (all workspace .md files)
- ✅ Real-time search (filter by name/path)

- ✅ Responsive layout, terminal-dark aesthetic
- ✅ Navigation between dashboard and docs

**Next phase (deferred):**
- Timeline view (chronological daily memory)
- Edit docs directly from browser
- Table of contents auto-generation
- Internal linking between docs

**Key lesson:** GC called out lack of progress updates after 1 hour of silence (10:52-11:44). Fixed by delivering incremental updates every 20-30 minutes with testable features.

### Model Router Shadow Validation
- **Status:** 14 classifications logged (target: 50-100)

## Evening Session (6:11 PM - 6:20 PM)

### Dashboard UX Feedback (GC Critical Review)

**Problems identified:**
1. Kanban items not clickable - should link to project files with full context
2. Memory feed hidden in sidebar - not prominent enough
3. Poor layout - big blank spaces, inefficient screen use
4. Lack of polish - feels unfinished, not production-ready
5. **Not useful** - doesn't help GC understand status at a glance

**Reference provided:**
- Nate Herk's OpenClaw dashboard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJovzVhlIo&t=288s
- Better layout, friendlier UX

**GC's request:**
- Wants comprehensive redesign roadmap and build plan
- Morning delivery (Melbourne time tomorrow)
- Iterative review tomorrow
- Questioned if claude frontend skill needed

**Response:**
- Created comprehensive redesign spec: `/workspace/specs/dashboard-redesign-v2.md`
- Researched ClawHub skills (found 6+ dashboard skills, 4+ UI skills)
- Top candidates: `mission-control-dashboard`, `superdesign`, `shadcn-ui`
- Committed to delivering polished plan tomorrow morning

**Key lesson:**
- **Building features ≠ building useful products**
- UX and polish matter as much as functionality
- Need to think about user flow and interaction patterns
- GC's feedback is exactly what I need to improve

**Tomorrow deliverables:**
1. Visual wireframes of new layout
2. Detailed component breakdown
3. Implementation timeline
4. Review of relevant ClawHub skills
5. Prioritized build plan

**Status:** Acknowledged, plan drafted, ready for morning review

## Overnight Research Session (6:50 PM - 7:00 PM)

### Dashboard Redesign Research (GC Request)

**Assignment:**
- Review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJovzVhlIo&t=288s (Nate Herk)
- Study creator's GitHub: https://gist.github.com/mberman84
- Extract learnings for dashboard build
- Deliver comprehensive plan by morning (Melbourne time)

**Research completed:**

1. **Matthew Berman (mberman84) Gist Analysis**
   - Analyzed PRD.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md patterns
   - Key insight: Separate files for separate purposes (PRD vs workflows vs guides)
   - Personality principle: "Have actual opinions, not 'it depends' hedging"
   - Token efficiency: Keep injected files focused, avoid duplication
   - Implementation prompts: Self-contained specs for each feature

2. **Wireframes Created** (`/research/dashboard-wireframes.md`)
   - Dashboard Home (overview with key metrics + active projects)
   - Project Detail View (clickable Kanban destination)
   - Memory Timeline (prominent chronological view)
   - Router Analytics Page (charts + detailed stats)
   - 4 complete ASCII art layouts with interaction specs

3. **Comprehensive Analysis** (`/research/nate-herk-dashboard-analysis.md`)
   - File structure recommendations
   - Dashboard philosophy shift (widgets → operating system)
   - Quick wins vs full redesign comparison
   - Implementation prompt library (Berman-style)
   - Token efficiency strategies

4. **Morning Review Package** (`/research/MORNING-REVIEW.md`)
   - Executive summary
   - Research findings
   - Proposed redesign (6 phases)
   - Implementation prompts (3 complete specs)
   - Questions for GC prioritization
   - Recommendation: Start with quick wins

**Key recommendations:**

**File Reorganization:**
- Split PROJECT-STATE.md into 5 focused files
- Archive old memory logs (7-day retention + monthly compression)
- Separate active from archive content

**Dashboard Philosophy:**
- Shift from "widgets showing data" to "operating system with apps"
- Every element should be clickable or actionable
- Personality in labels (opinionated, contextual advice)
- Chief of Staff aesthetic (structured, analytical, no fluff)

**Implementation Options:**
- **Quick wins (1 day):** Clickable Kanban + Memory prominence + Opinionated labels
- **Full redesign (3-4 days):** Complete overhaul with navigation, polish, charts

**Limitations:**
- Could not directly access YouTube video (web_fetch doesn't work with YouTube)
- Recommended GC provide transcript or screenshots if specific patterns needed
- Analysis based on Berman patterns + general UX principles

**Deliverables ready:**
- 3 comprehensive research documents (25KB total)
- 4 detailed wireframes
- 3 implementation prompts (ready to execute)
- Morning review package with executive summary

**Status:** Complete and ready for GC's morning review  
**Next:** Await GC's prioritization decisions, then execute chosen approach
