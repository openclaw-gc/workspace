## Early Morning (Post-Credit Restoration)

### Anthropic Credits Exhausted
- **Time:** ~2:41 AM - 3:11 AM AEDT (server time 18:41-19:11 Feb 17 GMT+8)
- **Impact:** Missed ~30 minutes of heartbeat monitoring
- **Lesson:** Need provider fallback (Anthropic → OpenAI on quota errors)
- **Resolution:** GC topped up credits at 3:11 AM, operations resumed

### Overnight Work Status
**What ran continuously:**
- Gmail monitoring (IMAP, every 10 min)
- Model router shadow validation (76 classifications logged)
- Heartbeat checks (when credits available)

**What didn't ship (credit gap interrupted):**
- Gmail API migration
- Calendar skill build
- GitHub automation (partially complete now)
- Agentic trading Phase 1
- Dashboard foundation
- Full thought leadership strategy (delivered post-restoration)

## Morning Deliverables (3:11 AM onwards)

### 1. Thought Leadership Strategy
- **File:** `deliverables/15-thought-leadership-strategy.md`
- **Size:** 16KB, comprehensive 90/180-day plan
- **Platforms:** LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Substack
- **Core positioning:** "The CFO who codes" - bridge TradFi discipline + crypto-native reflexivity
- **Content themes:** Treasury architecture, multi-factor intelligence, TradFi/crypto translation
- **Launch plan:** 90-day roadmap with specific tactics
- **First 30 post topics:** Frameworks, commentary, lessons, contrarian takes

**Key recommendations:**
- LinkedIn: 3x/week (frameworks + commentary)
- X: 5-7x/week (regime updates + threads + engagement)
- Substack: 2x/month (deep dives, eventually premium tier $20/mo)
- Voice: Precision over hype, structure over narrative, dry humor

**Content production split:**
- GC writes: High-signal analysis, regime calls, personal narrative
- Gale drafts: Structured explainers, research synthesis, repurposing

**Target metrics (90 days):**
- LinkedIn: 5K followers, 10K impressions/post
- X: 10K followers, 50K impressions/week
- Substack: 200 subscribers, 5 posts published

### 2. GitHub Automation
- **File:** `skills/github/auto-commit-hook.js`
- **Function:** Detects changes, auto-generates commit messages, pushes to GitHub
- **Watches:** MEMORY.md, PROJECT-STATE.md, daily logs, deliverables
- **Smart commit messages:** Categorizes changes (memory/deliverables/skills/other)
- **Logging:** Tracks all auto-commits to `memory/auto-commit-log.jsonl`

**Next:** Set up cron job for periodic auto-commits (hourly or on-change detection)

### 3. Model Router Shadow Validation
- **Status:** 76 classifications logged (target: 50-100)
- **Progress:** On track for evening analytics review
- **All classifications so far:** Simple tier (Haiku) - makes sense for heartbeat messages
- **Decision point:** Tonight at 7 PM AEDT - review analytics, decide on enforcement

## Remaining Overnight Queue

**Still to complete:**
1. **Gmail API migration** - Replace IMAP with Gmail API (faster, better features)
2. **Calendar skill** - Native calendar management via Google Calendar API
3. **Dashboard foundation** - Next.js project setup, core components
4. **Agentic trading Phase 1** - Coinbase CDP testnet setup

**Proceeding now** per GC's instruction at 3:17 AM.
